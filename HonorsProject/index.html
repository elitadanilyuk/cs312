                This website was created to help new and incoming software developers and computer science students. 
                Software development is such a large field of study many new learners are daunted by how much they need to know. 
                Our website is here to serve as a library of information and various resources. 
                These resources consist of various learning mediums such as links to articles, videos, live tutorials, and more.
